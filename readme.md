# My Terminal $PROFILE

## Introduction
> This repository was created for a place to store my $PROFILE settings for the Windows Terminal.
> I want to use the same $PROFILE across multiple devices so there's consistency in my experience.
> Since I use the terminal for my job in IT and in everyday use of the PC - I like to enchance my experience with the Terminal.
> Because of that I like to customize the appearance, look and feel of the terminal.
> I get excited about having complete freedom with my Terminal and can change it however I want it to be.
